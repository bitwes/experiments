Ways to background

Jobs
------------------
End the command with &
Ctrl+z then type bg

These can then be found by the "jobs" command.
Stop using kill %# where # is the id listed by "jobs"

Bring job to foreground using fg


nohup
------------------
Creates a process that runs even if you logout.  awesome.


Examples
------------------
Use infinite_loop.sh to mess with these

bash infinte_loop.sh > foo.out 2> foo.err < /dev/null &

bash infinte_loop.sh > foo.out
<ctrl+z> (stops job)
bg (backgrounds most recent job)
